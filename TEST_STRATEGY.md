# Test Strategy for ECHO Halal Certificate API

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the ECHO Halal Certificate API. The purpose of this strategy is to ensure the API is reliable, secure, and functions as expected.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

- API endpoints for authorization, signing, uploading, and creating certificates.
- Functional testing of all API features.
- Negative testing, including invalid inputs and error conditions.
- Security testing for authentication and authorization.
- Performance testing to ensure the API can handle the expected load.

### Out of Scope

- Frontend application testing.
- Third-party integration testing.
- Non-functional testing beyond performance (e.g., usability, accessibility).

## 3. Test Objectives

- To verify the API meets all functional requirements.
- To ensure the API is secure and protects against common vulnerabilities.
- To validate the API's performance under various load conditions.
- To identify and report all defects in a timely manner.

## 4. Testing Methodology

### Functional Testing

- **Endpoint Testing:** Each endpoint will be tested with valid and invalid inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Integration Testing:** The interaction between different API endpoints will be tested to ensure they work together correctly.
- **End-to-End Testing:** The entire workflow, from authorization to certificate creation, will be tested to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Security Testing

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Test cases will be designed to verify that only authorized users can access the API and that they can only perform actions they are permitted to.
- **Input Validation:** The API will be tested with malicious inputs to ensure it is not vulnerable to common attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

### Performance Testing

- **Load Testing:** The API will be tested with a high volume of requests to ensure it can handle the expected load.
- **Stress Testing:** The API will be pushed to its limits to identify its breaking point and ensure it can recover gracefully.

## 5. Test Environment

- **Test Server:** A dedicated test server will be used to deploy and test the API.
- **Test Data:** A comprehensive set of test data will be created, including valid and invalid inputs.
- **Test Tools:** The following tools will be used for testing:
  - **Postman:** For manual API testing.
  - **JMeter:** For performance testing.
  - **OWASP ZAP:** For security testing.

## 6. Test Deliverables

- **Test Plan:** A detailed test plan will be created, outlining the scope, objectives, and schedule of testing.
- **Test Cases:** A comprehensive set of test cases will be created to cover all functional, security, and performance requirements.
- **Test Report:** A final test report will be created, summarizing the results of testing and providing recommendations for improvement.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Test Lead:** Responsible for creating the test plan, managing the testing process, and reporting on the results of testing.
- **Test Engineers:** Responsible for creating and executing test cases, and for reporting defects.

## 8. Schedule

Testing will be conducted in the following phases:

- **Phase 1: Test Planning (1 week)**
- **Phase 2: Test Case Creation (2 weeks)**
- **Phase 3: Test Execution (4 weeks)**
- **Phase 4: Test Reporting (1 week)**
