# API Test Case Review

This document provides a review of the API test cases found in `src/App.js`.

## Overview

The test cases are organized into four main categories:

- **Authorization:** Verifies the API's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Sign Document:** Tests the digital signing of various certificate types.
- **Upload Document:** Verifies the uploading of signed documents.
- **Create Certificates:** Tests the creation of new certificates.

## Strengths

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** The test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including positive and negative test cases.
- **Clear and Concise:** Each test case has a clear and concise description, making it easy to understand its purpose.
- **Well-Structured:** The test cases are well-structured and easy to read, with a consistent format.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Lack of Automation:** The test cases are designed for manual execution, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
- **No Performance Testing:** There are no test cases for performance testing, which is essential for ensuring the API can handle the expected load.
- **No Security Testing:** There are no test cases for security testing, which is crucial for protecting the API against common vulnerabilities.

## Recommendations

- **Automate the Test Cases:** The test cases should be automated to improve efficiency and reduce the risk of human error.
- **Add Performance Test Cases:** Performance test cases should be added to ensure the API can handle the expected load.
- **Add Security Test Cases:** Security test cases should be added to protect the API against common vulnerabilities.
